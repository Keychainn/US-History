## The Republican Solution
## Aim: How did the system of government proposed in the Constitution aim to answer the threat of tyranny or domination by faction?

DN:
The Constitution was not a Counter-Revolution that reversed the accomplishments of the American Revolution, because it introduced changes and liberties that the colonists previously weren't able to enjoy. For example, it introduced a more refined system of representation for the colonists, solving the problem of "taxation without representation". The American Revolution did away with lack of representation and the quartering of soldiers, which remained after the Constitution was established. No monarchy.

### Was the constitution a counter-revolution?
#### What was the Nature of the Revolution?
- To some, it was about impositions by a central power.
	- Anti federalists, farmers
	- A Social revolution
		- I.e. social revolution - Shay's rebellion, for example, was questioning the authority of the elite to tax them.
		- government was restricting liberty.
- To others, it was about the legitimacy of Britain as a central power: colonists were concerned about the legitimacy of the British Crown - "taxation without representation is tyranny"
	- Nationalists, the gentlemen elite
		- A Political revolution
			- taxes were restricting liberty.

### The Nationalist Wish List
- ##### Merchants and Manufacturers and Workers
	- National tariff: People building stuff in America would have advantage over foreign goods
	- Common market to encourage interstate trade
		- Mercantile theory
	- National commercial policy to avoid conflict, standards of measure (weights, etc)
	- To gain the respect of European countries to facilitate trade.
- ##### Land speculators (entrepreneurs) wanted a gvt to:
	- subdue the "indian menace"
		- wanted it to be safe for whites to settle in midwest
	- Expel british from forts in ohio valley
	- enforce their claims against squatters
		- ppl like george washington bought land in ohio valley/midwest, and some ppl started to clear those lands and live there as if they were their own
- ##### The National Debt
	- Loans owed to France and the Dutch
		- repayment would make it easier for American merchants to get credit.
	- Paper currency
		- (The continental congress issued more paper money than they could back - becomes an issue of trust. Can you trust gvt to pay you back if you do trade it in?)
		- Commoners had used it or sold it at a discount.
			- The people who were paid with this currency had to use their currency at lower than face value
		- Most was now controlled by financiers aka speculators who bought it cheap
			- the rich were speculating and bought that paper money, betting that the gvt would make that money back
			- If the government would exchange currency at face value, they would make tremendous profits.

	### The problem of Tyranny (and consent)
	- The first concern of the framers about tyranny came from the people, or mob
	- __Republic__: a government in which citizens rule through their elected representatives rather than directly.
		- In the name of the people, but the power of the people goes through various **filters**.
			- Vote - white men who owned land: 15% of population.
			- State legislators chose Senators
			- the people vote for electoral college, who would then vote for the president
			- judiciary: selected by president, approved by senate
		- Tyranny: putting all powers in the same hands.
	- ##### Solutions:
		- Limited gvt
			- enumerated powers for the national gvt with the rest to the states or the people
